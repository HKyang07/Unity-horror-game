# Unity-horror-game
A group project of my course

This is my course's group project and I'm in charge of the coding task and object game logic implementation.  
The scene model is based on other's model file.  
The critical source code is in /Myscripts

The game file size is too large to upload, if you want to get it contact me.  
Here are some game screenshots:
